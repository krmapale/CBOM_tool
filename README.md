# Automated CycloneDX CBOM generator for Javascript files using the Node.js Crypto module

This project contains a prototype of an automated CycloneDX CBOM generator and some test files are also included. The tool ("pqcbom.js") is operated through a command line interface. 

Currently, the tool is only able to capture and create cryptographic algorithm components, but certificates and related crypto materials will be included as the development continues.
